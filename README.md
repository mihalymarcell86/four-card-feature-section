## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass, Flexbox and Grid

### What I learned

I usually use `grid-template-areas` when it comes to more complicated grid layouts, however I felt like that would be an overkill for this particular project, and I assigned each grid element to a particular row / column. I came to the realization, that the `grid-row` and `grid-column` properties are pretty much the 2D equivalents of the Flexbox `order` property.
